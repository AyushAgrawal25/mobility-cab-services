## Introduction

Beckn protocol is a collection of open specifications consisting of protocol APIs, message formats, network design and reference architectures to allow any two entities to execute commercial transactions without being on the same platform. The core protocol specifications are industry-sector-agnostic by design and allow sector-specific policies to be layered as machine readable code.    

This server-to-server communication protocol allows any consumer facing online platform to discover and transact with any business with minimal implementation overhead. The server-to-server nature of the protocol allows rich user experiences to be built by bundling services from multiple independent platforms. 

Beckn protocol taxi specification is a KOMN-specific adaptation of the [core protocol specification](https://github.com/beckn/protocol-specifications) for taxi and applies taxi specific rules and policies on its API and architecture.

Please see the [technical documentation](./doc/taxi.md) for more details.
